* 1 NodeMCU ESP8266 Breakout Board
* 1 Relay (generic)
* 1 IR receiver (generic)
* 1 IR transmitter (generic)

Software apps and online services
* Visual Studio 2015

Smart Parking: It is a system developed for commercial and private parking clients by controlling access via RFID system.

Why?

The work of this project is to facilitate private and commercial parking and the payment mechanism for the commercial parking management.

How does it work?

The project works as follows:

Each car parking has a RFID tag registered in the system
At the entrance of the parking lot, there are RFID reading devices; it reads the RFID tag remotely (3-10 meters range)
The verification of the validity of the entry and available balance is on the e-card
Payment mechanism: over time or daily, weekly or yearly
